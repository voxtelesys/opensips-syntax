# OpenSIPS Syntax Highlighting

This Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension provides basic syntax highlighting for OpenSIPS configuration files.

## Installation

This extension has not yet been published to the VSCode Marketplace, as it is still in beta.

To add the extension to VSCode, clone the project into your local VSCode folder:

- on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
- on Mac/Linux: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

Restart VSCode and the extension will automatically run everytime you open a file with a `.cfg` or `.cfg.m4` extension.
